### Exploratory Analysis on IPL Data

EDA is one of the most important aspects of any Data Science project. It easily accounts for 60-70% of work before one goes on to modelling. EDA is basically 'A first glance at the data'. In order to generate a good model from the dataset we first need to understand the data. EDA helps in achieving that. It summarizes data, finds patterns between data points and is often done presented via visual methods (diagrams, graphs) for easy understandability.

Real world data is most of the times unstructured and dirty in nature. If we do not perform EDA first and directly feed this data into any machine learning algorithm, then we can be pretty sure that we would not get any desireable result. As it is often said 'Garbage In Garbage Out'. EDA helps in identifying gaps in the data and then filling those gaps appropriately. 

The primary objective of any EDA process is to analyse the underlying structure of a dataset which can help in insight generation.

Any EDA comprises of the following steps
- Defining the problem statement
- Collecting data required for the problem
- Pre-processing of data
  - Pre-profiling
  - Processing data based on pre-profiling
  - Post profiling of data
  - Break down into high level topics based on problem statement
  - Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis on these topics to understand the data

An effective EDA performed on a dataset helps to identify relevant features that can fed to our machine learning algorithms and generate a good model with high predictve power.
